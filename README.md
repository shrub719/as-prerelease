# I'm Getting Tired

> Currently, the cost of digging (in terms of time and score) is a fixed constant. For each time the pirate digs, their score decreases by 10 and the dig time increases by 1.75.
>
> Have the cost of digging increase as time goes on. 
>
> The first three times the pirate digs should cost them 10 each. 
>
> Every dig attempt afterwards should 'cost' 2 points more i.e. 12, 14, 16...
>
> Have the pirate's current score display after every dig. 


Program amended to increase time taken to dig as the pirate gets tired.
