# Don't Dig Twice

> Currently, you are able to dig the same location (regardless of what is at the location) an infinite amount of times. Amend the code so that each location can only be dug once. You will have to include functionality around editing the hidden map in your solution.

Program amended to completely prevent the pirate from digging
into the same spot they have dug before.
