# Infinite Coconuts

> Currently, if you dig up a coconut, you can then dig it up infinitely, as there is no limit to the number of times the pirate can dig on the same spot. Amend the code so that each coconut can only be dug up once. If the pirate tries to dig a second time on the same grid spot after digging up the coconut, it should be treated as if they have dug on empty sand, and they find nothing. You will have to include functionality around editing the hidden map in your solution.

Program amended to replace dug spots with sand so e.g.
a coconut cannot be dug up twice.
